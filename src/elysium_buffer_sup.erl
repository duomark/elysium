%%%   The elysium buffer supervisor is an empty supervisor. Its only
%%%   purpose is to own the session and pending request ets_buffer
%%%   queues. These ets tables must have an owner that won't go down.
%%%   The first supervisor in a rest_for_one top level configuration
%%%   means that elysium_buffer_sup will be the first process to start
%%%   and the last to go down. It also avoids placing the ownership
%%%   of these queues with a gen_server or gen_fsm which serves the
%%%   double purpose of responding to queries. Such a setup would
%%%   risk losing the queues if there was a query request which could
%%%   crash the gen_server or gen_fsm. All queries about the queues
%%%   are handled by elysium_queue which is the 2nd process to start
%%%   after elysium_buffer_sup.
%%%
%%%   To further support fault tolerance and load balancing, the configuration
%%%   data identifies a list of Cassandra hosts to which live sessions
%%%   may be established. The list of hosts is kept in a queue so that
%%%   every attempt to connect or reconnect is a round-robin request against
%%%   a different host, skipping any that cannot successfully accept a new
%%%   connection request. Coupled with stochastic decay of existing connections
%%%   the active sessions will automatically adapt to the spontaneous
%%%   availability of Cassandra cluster client nodes for transactions.
